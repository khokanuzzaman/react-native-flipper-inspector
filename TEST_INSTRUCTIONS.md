# 🧪 Test Instructions - Debug Overlay App

## 📱 **APK Location**
The debug APK is ready at:
```
/Users/khokan/Desktop/npm packages/react-native-flipper-inspector/apps/example/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## 🔧 **Installation Steps**

### **Option 1: Connect Device and Install**
```bash
# Connect your Android device via USB
adb devices

# Install the APK
adb install "/Users/khokan/Desktop/npm packages/react-native-flipper-inspector/apps/example/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk"

# Launch the app
adb shell am start -n com.reactnativeflipperinspectorexample/.MainActivity
```

### **Option 2: Manual Installation**
1. Copy the APK to your device
2. Install it manually
3. Launch the app

## 🎯 **What to Test**

### **1. Basic App Functionality**
- ✅ App should launch and show "Debug Overlay Test" screen
- ✅ You should see test buttons and debug actions

### **2. Floating Button Test**
- ✅ Look for a **blue circular floating button** with 🔍 icon in the **bottom-right corner**
- ✅ Tap the floating button → Should show alert "You tapped the floating button!"

### **3. Overlay Import Test**
- ✅ Tap "🔧 Test Overlay Import" button
- ✅ Should show success alert if overlay component imports correctly
- ✅ Should show error alert if there are import issues

### **4. API Call Testing**
- ✅ Tap "📋 Get Users (GET)" button
- ✅ Make API calls and check console logs
- ✅ Should see network requests in console

## 🐛 **Debugging Steps**

### **If Floating Button Doesn't Appear:**
1. Check if the app is showing the debug screen
2. Look for any error messages in the alerts
3. Try the "Test Overlay Import" button to see if there are import issues

### **If Overlay Import Fails:**
The issue is with the package import. This means:
- The overlay component isn't being built correctly
- There's a dependency issue
- The package isn't being linked properly

### **If Everything Works:**
Great! The overlay component is working. You should see:
- Floating button in bottom-right corner
- API monitoring functionality
- Copy/share features

## 📋 **Expected Results**

### **✅ Success Case:**
- App launches with debug screen
- Blue floating button visible in bottom-right
- "Test Overlay Import" shows success
- API calls work and show in console

### **❌ Failure Case:**
- App launches but no floating button
- "Test Overlay Import" shows error
- Need to debug the package import issue

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

Based on the test results:

1. **If it works:** We can integrate the real overlay component
2. **If it fails:** We need to debug the package import and fix the overlay component

**Please test the app and let me know what you see!** 🚀
