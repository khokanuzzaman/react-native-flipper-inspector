# üéØ Testing Guide - Draggable Floating Button

## ‚ú® NEW FEATURE: Draggable Floating Button

The floating üîç button is now **fully draggable and interactive**!

---

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Reconnect Your Device

Make sure your Android device is connected via USB and USB debugging is enabled:

```bash
# Check device connection
adb devices

# Should show:
# List of attached devices
# YOUR_DEVICE_ID    device
```

If offline, try:
```bash
# Restart adb
adb kill-server
adb start-server

# Then check again
adb devices
```

### Step 2: Metro is Already Running

The Metro bundler should still be running from the previous command. If not:

```bash
cd apps/example
npm start
```

### Step 3: Install and Run the App

```bash
npm run android
```

## üß™ Testing the Draggable Button

Once the app launches, test these features:

### ‚úÖ Test 1: Quick Tap Opens Inspector
- **Action**: Quickly tap the üîç button
- **Expected**: Inspector overlay opens
- **What to look for**: 
  - Inspector UI appears
  - Shows API call list
  - Search box is visible

  - Bottom-right corner (original position)
- **Expected**: Works smoothly in all positions
- **What to look for**:
  - Button stays on screen
  - No jank or lag

### ‚úÖ Test 4: Tap After Dragging
- **Action**: 
  1. Drag button to new position
  2. Quickly tap it
- **Expected**: Inspector still opens
- **What to look for**:
  - Button opens inspector from new position
  - Inspector works same as before

### ‚úÖ Test 5: Verify Button Boundaries
- **Action**: Try to drag button beyond screen edges

  1. Tap to open inspector
  2. Search for API calls
  3. View call details
  4. Copy cURL command
- **Expected**: All features work the same
- **What to look for**:
  - Search filtering works
  - Can open details
  - Copy buttons work
  - JSON highlighting displays

## üìä Implementation Details

### How the Dragging Works:

1. **Touch Detection** (200ms threshold)
   - < 200ms = Quick tap ‚Üí Opens inspector
   - > 200ms = Hold & drag ‚Üí Moves button

2. **Position Tracking**
   - Records initial finger position
   - Calculates offset as you drag
   - Updates button position in real-time

3. **Boundary Safety**
   - Prevents button from going off-screen
   - Uses screen width/height to calculate bounds
   - Smooth boundary collision

4. **Smart Click vs Drag**
   - Distinguishes between click and drag
   - No false positives when opening inspector
   - Responsive to both quick taps and drags

## üé® Visual Features

### Professional Design:
- ‚úÖ Gradient background (purple to blue)
- ‚úÖ Circular shape (border-radius: 56dp)
- ‚úÖ Smooth shadows/elevation (16dp)
- ‚úÖ 112x112dp size (perfect for touch)

### Interaction Feedback:
- ‚úÖ Smooth drag animation
- ‚úÖ Real-time position updates
- ‚úÖ No lag during dragging
- ‚úÖ Responsive to all gestures

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Button Not Dragging
**Problem**: Button doesn't move when dragging
**Solution**:
- Make sure you're holding (> 200ms) before moving
- Try a slower drag motion
- Check that device is not in battery saver mode

### Button Goes Off-Screen
**Problem**: Button disappears when dragging
**Solution**:
- This shouldn't happen! But if it does, restart the app
- The boundary detection should prevent this

### App Crashes on Drag
**Problem**: App crashes when dragging button
**Solution**:
- Rebuild the app: `npm run android`
- Check logcat for errors: `adb logcat`
- Restart adb: `adb kill-server && adb start-server`

### Inspector Won't Open
**Problem**: Tapping button doesn't open inspector
**Solution**:
- Make sure tap is quick (< 200ms)
- Try a single quick tap in the center of the button
- Verify the app is fully loaded first

## üìù Code Changes Made

### File: `MainActivity.java`

**What Changed:**
- Replaced `setOnClickListener()` with `setOnTouchListener()`
- Added `MotionEvent` import
- Implemented touch event handling with:
  - `ACTION_DOWN`: Record initial position
  - `ACTION_MOVE`: Calculate and update position
  - `ACTION_UP`: Detect click vs drag

**Key Variables:**
- `dX`, `dY`: Touch offset calculation
- `downTime`: When finger touched (for click detection)
- `LONG_PRESS_THRESHOLD`: 200ms (distinguishes click from drag)

**Boundary Protection:**
```java
newX = Math.max(0, Math.min(newX, screenWidth - 112));
newY = Math.max(0, Math.min(newY, screenHeight - 112));
```
