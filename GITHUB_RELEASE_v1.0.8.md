# 🐛 Critical Bug Fix - v1.0.8

## Overview

This release resolves a critical bug that was causing crashes in older React Native projects with the error:

```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'method' of undefined
```

**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Bug Fix  
**Breaking Changes:** None  
**Upgrade Required:** Highly Recommended

---

## 🔥 The Problem

Users of older React Native projects (especially pre-0.70) were experiencing crashes when using the network monitoring features of this package. The error occurred due to a variable naming conflict in the minified JavaScript code.

### Affected Users
- 📱 React Native projects < 0.70
- 🔧 Projects with aggressive minification settings
- 🌐 Applications using `patchNetwork()` or network monitoring
- 🎯 Apps with the `ReactNativeInspectorOverlay` component

---

## ✅ The Solution

We've completely resolved the issue by:

1. **Renamed Variables**: Changed HTTP method variable from `method` to `httpMethod` to avoid minification conflicts
2. **Global Compatibility**: Updated all `global` references to `globalThis` for better cross-environment support
3. **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript declarations for global scope
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Added automated tests to prevent similar issues

### Code Changes

**Before (Problematic):**
```typescript
const method = init?.method || 'GET';
// After minification: method.method ❌
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
const httpMethod = init?.method || 'GET';
// After minification: method: p ✅
```

    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => console.log('✅ Working!', data))
    .catch(err => console.error('❌ Error:', err));
  
  return <YourApp />;
}
```

**Expected Result:** No errors, network requests monitored successfully!
