### Post 3: Behind the Scenes (Personal & Authentic)

**Format**: Story-style post

---

📖 **Building in Public: How I Created React Native Flipper Inspector**

Starting a project is one thing. Finishing it? That's another story.

I wanted to solve a real problem in my own work: **React Native debugging was painful.** 😫

So I built **React Native Flipper Inspector** – a professional debugging toolkit that:
- Monitors network requests in real-time
- Shows beautiful, searchable API data
- Works seamlessly on Android & iOS
- Requires zero configuration
- Is completely free and open-source

**The Journey:**
🔴 v1.0.0 - Initial release (core features)
🟡 v1.0.1-3 - Bug fixes, stabilization, new features
🟢 v1.0.4-5 - Documentation, screenshots, user guides
🟢 v1.0.6 - Fixed distribution, polish
🟢 v1.0.7 - Added funding, complete project story ✅

**What I Learned:**
✅ Open source is rewarding but requires commitment
✅ Documentation matters as much as code
✅ Community feedback drives better features
✅ Sustainable projects need sustainable funding
✅ Shipping fast beats perfection

**The Mission:**
I believe React Native debugging should be as easy as console.log. That's what I'm building toward.

**What's Next?**
v2.0 is coming with Postman-like features, analytics, and mocking capabilities.

**How You Can Help:**
- ⭐ Star the repository
- 🐛 Report bugs & suggest features
- 🤝 Contribute code
- 💰 Consider sponsoring (even $2/month helps!)
