**Coverage: ~98% of React Native HTTP traffic!**

### 🔧 **Bug Fixes**

1. **Android Gradle Build** ✅
   - Fixed: "Could not get unknown property 'release' for SoftwareComponent"
   - Safe component resolution for all AGP versions

2. **Null Safety** ✅
   - Comprehensive null checks in FloatingInspector
   - Optional chaining for all API call properties

✅ Status: Complete visibility of all requests
```

## 📊 Technical Changes

### 1. Enhanced Network Interceptor
**File:** `packages/react-native-flipper-inspector/src/core/networkInterceptor.ts`

```typescript
// BEFORE (v1.0.11)
class NetworkInterceptor {
  private originalFetch: typeof fetch;
  
  startIntercepting() {
    this.patchFetch(); // Only Fetch
  }
}

// AFTER (v1.0.12)
class NetworkInterceptor {
  private originalFetch: typeof fetch;
  private originalXHROpen: typeof XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open;   // NEW!
  private originalXHRSend: typeof XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send;   // NEW!
  
  startIntercepting() {
    this.patchFetch();          // Fetch
    this.patchXMLHttpRequest(); // XHR - NEW!
  }
  
  private patchXMLHttpRequest() {
    // Intercepts ALL XHR-based libraries
    // Captures request/response for Axios, Superagent, etc.
  }
}
```

### 2. Fixed Android Build
**File:** `packages/react-native-flipper-inspector/android/build.gradle`

```gradle
afterEvaluate { project ->
    publishing {
        publications {
            def releaseComponent = project.components.findByName("release")
            if (releaseComponent != null) {  // ← SAFE CHECK
                release(MavenPublication) {
                    from releaseComponent
                    groupId = 'com.reactnativeflipperinspector'
                    artifactId = 'react-native-flipper-inspector'
                    version = '1.0.0'
                }
            }
