## 🤖 Android Testing

### Issue Detected
Android SDK location not configured. You need to set up the Android environment.

### Quick Fix Options

#### Option 1: Set ANDROID_HOME (Recommended)

```bash
# Find your Android SDK location (common paths):
# macOS: ~/Library/Android/sdk
# Linux: ~/Android/Sdk

# Set ANDROID_HOME
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

# Add to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile to make permanent
echo 'export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Verify
echo $ANDROID_HOME
```

#### Option 2: Create local.properties File

```bash
cd /Users/jotnosqh/Desktop/npm-packages/react-native-flipper-inspector/apps/example/android

# Create local.properties with your SDK path
echo "sdk.dir=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk" > local.properties

# Verify file was created
cat local.properties
```

### After Setting Up SDK

```bash
# Make sure you have an Android emulator running or device connected
adb devices

# Run the app
cd /Users/jotnosqh/Desktop/npm-packages/react-native-flipper-inspector/apps/example
npx react-native run-android
```

---

## 🍎 iOS Testing (Alternative)

If you have Xcode installed, you can test on iOS instead:

```bash
cd /Users/jotnosqh/Desktop/npm-packages/react-native-flipper-inspector/apps/example

# Install pods
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Run on iOS simulator
npx react-native run-ios
```

---

## 🌐 Web Testing (Easiest Option)

If you have Expo installed, you can test in a web browser:

```bash
cd /Users/jotnosqh/Desktop/npm-packages/react-native-flipper-inspector/apps/example

# Install expo if not already installed
npm install

# Start in web mode
npx expo start --web
```

**Or open in browser directly:**
```
http://localhost:8081
```

## 💡 Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Metro Bundler**: Should be running without errors
2. **Check Device/Emulator**: `adb devices` should show connected device
3. **Check Logs**: Look for error messages in console
4. **Restart Everything**: Sometimes a fresh start helps!

```bash
# Kill Metro
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9

# Clear cache
cd /Users/jotnosqh/Desktop/npm-packages/react-native-flipper-inspector/apps/example
npm start -- --reset-cache
```
